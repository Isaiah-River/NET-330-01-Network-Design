# Course Progression
## Week 1 
#### [Lecture - IP Addressing Review](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16752448/Week-1-NET-330-Notes.pptx.1.pdf)
### Labs:
* #### [Lab 01-1 - Simple Network Hardware Lab](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Simple-Network-Hardware-Lab)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f03473b4-2040-4217-95e1-7c12fce3937b), we did some basic hands-on review by hooking up a CNCS router to two switches. We then connected a Kali VM to each of these switches and configured each VM as well as the router so that each of the VMs would be able to ping one another.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Connect gear properly.
>* Configure the CNCS router.
>* Boot into Kali off of USB sticks.
>* Configure each Kali VM.
>* Successfully ping each VM.

* #### [Lab 01-2 - Register for Cisco Net Academy](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%902-%E2%80%90-Register-for-Cisco-Net-Academy)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ac2fa2-752b-4bfa-b890-bd9ecb2042b0), we just ensured that we have registered for Cisco's Packet Tracer 101 course and that we've installed Packet Tracer 8.1.1
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Sign up for Cisco's Packet Tracer 101 Course
> * Install Packet Tracer 8.1.1
* #### [Lab 01-3 - Packet Tracer Review-Class Lab](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%903-%E2%80%90-Packet-Tracer-Review-%E2%80%90-Class-Lab)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c52dc2-dcf1-4872-9702-5c59e16b8f2a), I did what was essentially a repeat of [Lab 01-1](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Simple-Network-Hardware-Lab), except this time doing my work in packet tracer instead of physically.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Wire and power hardware properly.
> * Configure the CNCS router.
> * Configure both laptop and server
> * Successfully ping the server from the laptop.
> * Analyze details of an HTTP packet.

### Assignments:
* #### [Assignment 01-1 - IP Addressing Assignment](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Assignment-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-IP-Addressing-Assignment)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [assignment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24181cf9-816c-4ebd-8855-7ff80d998502), I reviewed and got more practice with IP addressing, covering several basic topics touched on by previous NET classes.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Converting decimal addresses into binary.
> * Annotating binary place values within an IP octet.
> * Converting binary netmasks into CIDR notation.
> * Determining Net and Host IDs from an IP with a netmask.
> * Collecting various network information from our local network.
> * Looking into recent news regarding IPv6 adoption.

## Week 2

#### [Lecture - Subnetting, VLANs, & Cisco Commands](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16840065/NET-330-Week2-SubnettingVLANsCisco.pptx.pdf)

#### [Lecture - Subnetting In Detail](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16840078/NET-330-Week2-SubnettingDetailed.pptx.pdf)

### Labs:

* #### [Lab 02-1 - Subnet Design](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-02%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Subnet-Design)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30fb6c60-8e09-4553-bd18-8f28e91b4c3b), I built a small network design for a school in Packet Tracer to get some practice subnetting and using VLANs.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Building and completing an IP table to fit requirements.
> * Setting up VLANs across various switches
> * Configuring PCs with IPv4 information
> * Using CLI to:
>     * Configure interfaces VLANs

> **Overview:**
>
> In this [assignment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d6a8fd0-7b5c-417a-8184-9c604177130a), I reviewed subnetting by completing some IP tables.
>
> **Objectives:**
> * Determine the most efficient subnet mask to use.
> * Calculate and complete IP tables.

* #### Subnetting Homework
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [assignment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22c79d3f-1bf8-4050-80aa-dded338e10c5), I did some research on the benefits of subnetting,  gained more experience putting together subnetting IP tables, and answered various other questions about subnetting.
