# Course Overview
### Course Description

This course examines the basic principles and methodologies for designing local and wide area networks. Topics include network options analysis, component and protocol selection, performance considerations, and RFP development.

### Topic Coverage

* The role of network devices, operating systems, and protocols in a working network
* Factors affecting network performance evolution of networks
* Cost-benefit analysis of network changes
* Network Security
* LAN and WAN design
* Wireless networking and emergent technologies
* Tradeoffs in performance and cost
* Ethics in sysadmin, network administration
* Economics of corporate IT
* Complexity of modern networks and impact of changes
* How to design and develop a network that can accommodate growth and change
* How to integrate various technologies into an existing network.

# Course Progression
## Week 1 
#### [Lecture - IP Addressing Review](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16752448/Week-1-NET-330-Notes.pptx.1.pdf)
### Labs:
* #### [Lab 01-1 - Simple Network Hardware Lab](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Simple-Network-Hardware-Lab)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f03473b4-2040-4217-95e1-7c12fce3937b), we did some basic hands-on review by hooking up a CNCS router to two switches. We then connected a Kali VM to each of these switches and configured each VM as well as the router so that each of the VMs would be able to ping one another.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Connect gear properly.
>* Configure the CNCS router.
>* Boot into Kali off of USB sticks.
>* Configure each Kali VM.
>* Successfully ping each VM.

* #### [Lab 01-2 - Register for Cisco Net Academy](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%902-%E2%80%90-Register-for-Cisco-Net-Academy)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ac2fa2-752b-4bfa-b890-bd9ecb2042b0), we just ensured that we have registered for Cisco's Packet Tracer 101 course and that we've installed Packet Tracer 8.1.1
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Sign up for Cisco's Packet Tracer 101 Course
> * Install Packet Tracer 8.1.1
* #### [Lab 01-3 - Packet Tracer Review-Class Lab](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%903-%E2%80%90-Packet-Tracer-Review-%E2%80%90-Class-Lab)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c52dc2-dcf1-4872-9702-5c59e16b8f2a), I did what was essentially a repeat of [Lab 01-1](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Simple-Network-Hardware-Lab), except this time doing my work in packet tracer instead of physically.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Wire and power hardware properly.
> * Configure the CNCS router.
> * Configure both laptop and server
> * Successfully ping the server from the laptop.
> * Analyze details of an HTTP packet.

### Assignments:
* #### [Assignment 01-1 - IP Addressing Assignment](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Assignment-1%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-IP-Addressing-Assignment)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [assignment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24181cf9-816c-4ebd-8855-7ff80d998502), I reviewed and got more practice with IP addressing, covering several basic topics touched on by previous NET classes.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Converting decimal addresses into binary.
> * Annotating binary place values within an IP octet.
> * Converting binary netmasks into CIDR notation.
> * Determining Net and Host IDs from an IP with a netmask.
> * Collecting various network information from our local network.
> * Looking into recent news regarding IPv6 adoption.
