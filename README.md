* Factors affecting network performance evolution of networks
* Cost benefit analysis of network changes
* Network Security
* LAN and WAN design
* Wireless networking and emergent technologies
* Tradeoffs in performance and cost
* Ethics in sysadmin, network administration
* Economics of corporate IT

# Course Progression
## Week 1 
#### [Lecture - IP Addressing Review](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16752448/Week-1-NET-330-Notes.pptx.1.pdf)
### Labs:
* #### [Lab 01-1 - Simple Network Hardware Lab](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Simple-Network-Hardware-Lab)
> **Overview:**
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f03473b4-2040-4217-95e1-7c12fce3937b), we did some basic hands-on review by hooking up a CNCS router to two switches. We then connecting a Kali VM to each of these switches, and configured each VM as well as the router so that each of VMs would be able to ping one another.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Connect gear properly.
>* Configure the CNCS router.
>* Boot into Kali off of USB sticks.
>* Configure each Kali VM.
>* Successfully ping each VM.

* #### [Lab 01-2 - Register for Cisco Net Academy](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%902-%E2%80%90-Register-for-Cisco-Net-Academy)
> **Overview:**
>
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ac2fa2-752b-4bfa-b890-bd9ecb2042b0), we just ensured that we have registered for Cisco's Packet Tracer 101 course, and that we've installed Packet Tracer 8.1.1
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Sign up for Cisco's Packet Tracer 101 Course
> * Install Packet Tracer 8.1.1
* #### [Lab 01-3 - Packet Tracer Review-Class Lab](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%903-%E2%80%90-Packet-Tracer-Review-%E2%80%90-Class-Lab)
> **Overview:**
> In this [lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c52dc2-dcf1-4872-9702-5c59e16b8f2a), I did what was essentially a repeat of [Lab 01-1](https://github.com/Isaiah-River/NET-330-01-Network-Design/wiki/Lab-01%E2%80%901-%E2%80%90-Simple-Network-Hardware-Lab), except this time doing my work in packet tracer instead of physically.
>
> **Objectives:**
>
> * Wire and power hardware properly.
> * Configure the CNCS router.
> * Configure both laptop and server
> * Successfully ping the server from the laptop.
> * Analyze details of an HTTP packet.
